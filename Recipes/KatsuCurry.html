    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Neutral oil (e.g., vegetable), as needed</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>50g peanut butter, with no added sugar</li>
        <li>500ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1-2 red chillies, deseeded (retain seeds for added heat) and finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Plain flour, as needed</li>
        <li>Panko breadcrumbs, as needed (~150g)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>White rice (quantity as instructed by packet)</li>
        <li>2 finely sliced spring onions, for garnish</li>
 
    </ul>

<h3 class = "inst">Instructions: Curry Sauce</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Heat 2 tbsp of a neutral oil in a frying pan until hot. Optionally, at this stage add chilli flakes to achieve desired heat. Cook the onion and carrots for a few minutes until they just start to soften, then add the garlic and curry powder, stirring to ensure it does not burn on the bottom of the pan.
 </li>
<li>Cook the curry powder for a minute or so, until it becomes aromatic, then add the peanut butter and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, and cover, stirring occasionally. Add more turmeric to achieve a yellower colour. Once the vegetables are cooked through, remove from the heat, add the garam masala and optionally some of the chopped chilli for extra heat, and purée into a smooth sauce. It can be reheated before serving.
  </li>
<h3 class = "inst">Instructions: Chicken Katsu</h3>
<li> Cut each chicken breast into two pieces. If possible, flatten them a little with a mallet or pan to make them a little thinner – they will cook more evenly, and you’ll need less oil.
 </li>
<li> Set up three bowls, with the flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs. Season the flour with salt, pepper, and turmeric. Coat each piece of chicken in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. It’s a good idea to use a different hand for the wet and dry ingredients.
 </li>
<li> Heat neutral oil in a reasonably high-sided pan, enough to come half-way up the chicken breast pieces. Once hot, shallow fry the chicken breast pieces, about 5 minutes per side or until gold brown and crispy. Once cooked, remove from the oil, and drain on paper towel.
 </li>
<li> Serve with rice and garnish with spring onions and remaining chilli. </li>
