<ol>
<li>Cream marg and sugar, add egg beaten whole and mix well. Add Flour, salt and soda mixed together. Lastly add chocolate chips (or ½ cup of nuts or
cherries or anything else you like!)
 </li>
<li>Drop by 1/2 tsp onto greased bakingtray (they spread a lot so don't put
them too close together). Bake 10 to 12 minutes in 160 degrees. Put them straight on a cooling rack , don't leave them on the tray or you will have to
chip them off.
  </li>
<li> This mixture makes about 50 to 60. Will freeze, with freezer wrap between layers, but not so crisp afterwards obviously. Have been known to eat them frozen !
